# Contributor's guide

## Contributor license agreement

LDBC is open for community contributions. The LDBC membership agreement includes a contributor license agreement (CLA).

Non LDBC-member contributors need to sign a separate CLA:

* [individual CLA](https://ldbcouncil.org/docs/LDBC.Individual.Contributor.License.Agreement.Form-2020-10-23.pdf)
* [organizational CLA](https://ldbcouncil.org/docs/LDBC.Organization.Contributor.License.Agreement.Form-2020-10-23.pdf)

## Benchmarking

If you plan to publish results of LDBC benchmarks, please reach out to the steering committee at info@ldbcouncil.org
